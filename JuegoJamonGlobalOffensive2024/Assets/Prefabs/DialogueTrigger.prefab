    sentences: []
  - name: Mr. Komedy
    sentences:
    - Hello! Welcome to my humble theatre, the Zoomedy Club! You will be in charge
      of the microphone of our comedian, Mr Cass!
    - You see, Mr Cass' sense of humour can sometimes be pretty bad, but I don't
      want to hurt his feelings! If we want to keep this theatre going, I'll need
      you to *mute his bad jokes* so our *audience doesn't leave.*
    - I've already marked the *bad ones* in <YELLOW>. It'll be our little secret...
      I'll trust you! Oh, I almost forgot. Remember to *press the red button in order
      to start the show!*
  - name: Mr. Komedy
    sentences:
    - Hello! You're doing such a great job, so I thought that we could add Mr. Axoslow
      to our little team.
    - He's going to *play the drums* when you tell him, so now everyone will know
      when to laugh, like in those modern TV shows!
    - I've *marked the EXACT POINTS* where I need you to signal Mr. Axoslow, so make
      sure to follow the script!
  - name: Mr. Komedy
    sentences:
    - Hi! The theatre is growing without limit, you're making me think maybe it's
      you who should run things around here! We must fulfill expectations, so I added
      some new functions to your table.
    - As you know, Mr Cass finds it difficult to climb to his seat, so we thought
      we would let him *walk around the stage*. Now we only need you to *keep the
      light pointing at him AT EVERY MOMENT*. I know you can do it!
  - name: Mr. Komedy
    sentences:
    - Hi! I could not thank you enough. Now the Zoomedy Club is amongst the most
      famous comedy theatres in the country! To celebrate, I thought we could really
      take advantage of our newfound fame and hire a *second comedian!*
    - From now on, Ms Delilah will also be acting besides Mr Cass. If I'm honest
      with you, sometimes her humour is a little... dark. But she looked so intimidating
      I just had to hire her...
    - 'Please, do the same things that you do with Mr Cass and *mute her microphone*.
      This time, I marked the *bad jokes* in <PURPLE>. Also, *both comedians have
      their own lights*, keep it in mind! '
